# Edge_detection
In this repo we will see popular edge detection method i.e,canny edge 
detection. It is used in popular task like lane detection,border removal 
and sketching.

steps involved are - 

1- Noise reduction using Guassian filter
2- Gradient calculation using vertical axis.
3- Non Maximum Suppression for false edge detection
   it is technique used in various Computer vision task.It is used to find 
   the best bounding box in object detection algo. We can choose the 
   selection criteria to get desired result.
4- Double thresholding for segmenting strong & weak edge.
5- edge tracking by hystersis.
